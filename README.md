This project is a simple password generator application built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). 
The program generates a random, secure password based on the user's specified length and provides an option to copy the generated password to the clipboard using the pyperclip library.

Libraries Used:
1.	tkinter: A standard Python library used for creating graphical user interfaces.
2.	random: A standard Python library used for generating random values.
3.	string: A standard Python library used for accessing string constants like uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation.
4.	pyperclip: A third-party Python library used for copying text to the clipboard.


Conclusion:
This project provides a simple yet effective tool for generating random passwords, with the option to copy them to the clipboard for easy use. 
It's an excellent example of how to combine Python's standard libraries with third-party modules to create a functional application with a graphical user interface.
